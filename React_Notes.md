# Learn React Notes 

It's a JavaScript library that is made for User interface. It's supposed to be able to help Single page applications. The High-speed virutal DOM (Document Object Model) reloads by itself. 

**Functional Programming** - using functions rather than object oriented programming 

**Immuatability** - we would be creating duplicates of an object and replacing them rather than trying to mutate the original 

**DOM** - refers to the API that the page elements need and helps them change if something needs to be modified. 

JavaScript Objects are faster than DOM objects. React Virtual DOM is a JS object. It never reads from the real DOM and only writes if there are changes that need to happen.
